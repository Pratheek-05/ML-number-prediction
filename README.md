# ML-number-prediction
This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset.

Features of this Project:-
1. Uses TensorFlow & Keras for model building
2. Uses MNIST dataset (built into TensorFlow, so no external API required)
3. Implements CNN with Convolution & Pooling layers
4. Plots training vs. validation accuracy & loss
5. Predicts and visualizes handwritten digits


PS:- this project is running on google colab
